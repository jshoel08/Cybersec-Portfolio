# Jaiden Shoel Cybersec-Portfolio
Welcome! This is a collection of projects showcasing my cybersecurity skills, completed through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and my coursework at the University of Washington (Cybersecurity focus). (Links to PDFs of my Projects can be found below my README.md)

## Projects
INFO 310:

### INFO 310 – University of Washington

#### Remediation & Testing of Web Application Vulnerabilities
- **Tools:** PHP, Chrome DevTools, VS Code, Selenium (pytest)  
- Patched critical vulnerabilities (unrestricted file upload, insecure cookies, session fixation, missing CSRF tokens, missing X-Frame-Options headers) in a password manager web app.  
- Implemented secure coding practices (CSRF tokens, secure cookie settings, anti-clickjacking headers).  
- Validated fixes using automated test scripts to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation and Defense
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Docker, PHP, Chrome  
- Performed SQL injection attacks to bypass authentication and demonstrated XSS injections.  
- Remediated issues using prepared SQL statements and proper output sanitization.  
- Connected lab work to real-world breaches like the ResumeLooters campaign.

#### Offensive Security with Metasploit (Reverse Shell Exploit)
- **Tools:** Metasploit, msfvenom, PHP, Docker  
- Uploaded a malicious payload into a vulnerable web app to simulate an attacker scenario.  
- Used Metasploit to establish a reverse TCP shell and gained interactive server access.  
- Reinforced importance of input validation, least privilege, and restricting executable uploads.

#### Application Logging & Monitoring
- **Tools:** Loggly, Docker, VS Code  
- Configured centralized logging to monitor failed logins, password resets, and admin actions.  
- Explored strategies to detect brute-force login attempts and suspicious account activity.  
- Highlighted logging as both a **security camera** and **forensic trail**.

#### Applying Cryptography with TLS/HTTPS
- **Tools:** OpenSSL, nginx, Docker, Wireshark  
- Implemented HTTPS on a local web application by generating TLS certificates and configuring nginx.  
- Compared unencrypted vs encrypted traffic in Wireshark during a simulated MITM attack.  
- Demonstrated how TLS protects confidentiality/integrity and why trusted CAs are required.

### Google Cybersecurity Certificate

#### SIEM Investigation (Splunk)
- Analyzed authentication logs to identify brute-force login attempts.  
- Built queries and visualizations to track suspicious IP activity.  
- Produced an incident-style report with recommendations.  

#### Wireshark Network Analysis
- Captured and inspected network traffic for anomalies.  
- Detected suspicious DNS queries and abnormal packet activity.  
- Documented findings and provided mitigation strategies.  

#### Risk Assessment Report
- Conducted a mock assessment using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  
- Identified gaps in security posture for a small business scenario.  
- Delivered actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Research & Policy Projects

### JSIS 480 – Philippines Cybersecurity Profile
- **Focus:** Researched the Philippines’ domestic and international cybersecurity posture.  
- **What I Did:**  
  - Analyzed domestic frameworks (Data Privacy Act, Cybercrime Prevention Act) and their challenges with enforcement and surveillance.  
  - Evaluated international engagement in internet governance forums (IGF, OEWG, ASEAN, Paris Call, Budapest Convention).  
  - Assessed the balance between geopolitical tensions (South China Sea disputes) and capacity-building needs.  
- **Outcome:** Produced a research profile highlighting the Philippines as an emerging cyber actor with strong international participation but ongoing domestic vulnerabilities.  

### Task Force 2025 – Subsea Cable Security
- **Focus:** Contributed to a capstone Task Force on international information infrastructure security.  
- **What I Did:**  
  - Researched undersea cable sabotage incidents (2015–2019) and compiled a dataset of suspicious activity.  
  - Assessed global vulnerabilities in subsea infrastructure and resilience strategies.  
  - Co-authored recommendations presented to senior policymakers, including a U.S. Air Force Major General.  
- **Outcome:** Strengthened understanding of cyber-physical infrastructure risks and the policy frameworks needed for resilience.
