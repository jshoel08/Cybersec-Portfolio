# Jaiden Shoel Cybersec-Portfolio
Welcome! This is a collection of projects showcasing my cybersecurity skills, completed through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and my coursework at the University of Washington (Cybersecurity focus).

## Projects
INFO 310:

### INFO 310 â€“ University of Washington

#### Remediation & Testing of Web Application Vulnerabilities
- **Tools:** PHP, Chrome DevTools, VS Code, Selenium (pytest)  
- Patched critical vulnerabilities (unrestricted file upload, insecure cookies, session fixation, missing CSRF tokens, missing X-Frame-Options headers) in a password manager web app.  
- Implemented secure coding practices (CSRF tokens, secure cookie settings, anti-clickjacking headers).  
- Validated fixes using automated test scripts to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.



#### SQL Injection & Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation and Defense
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Docker, PHP, Chrome  
- Performed SQL injection attacks to bypass authentication and demonstrated XSS injections.  
- Remediated issues using prepared SQL statements and proper output sanitization.  
- Connected lab work to real-world breaches like the ResumeLooters campaign.

#### Offensive Security with Metasploit (Reverse Shell Exploit)
- **Tools:** Metasploit, msfvenom, PHP, Docker  
- Uploaded a malicious payload into a vulnerable web app to simulate an attacker scenario.  
- Used Metasploit to establish a reverse TCP shell and gained interactive server access.  
- Reinforced importance of input validation, least privilege, and restricting executable uploads.

#### Application Logging & Monitoring
- **Tools:** Loggly, Docker, VS Code  
- Configured centralized logging to monitor failed logins, password resets, and admin actions.  
- Explored strategies to detect brute-force login attempts and suspicious account activity.  
- Highlighted logging as both a **security camera** and **forensic trail**.

#### Applying Cryptography with TLS/HTTPS
- **Tools:** OpenSSL, nginx, Docker, Wireshark  
- Implemented HTTPS on a local web application by generating TLS certificates and configuring nginx.  
- Compared unencrypted vs encrypted traffic in Wireshark during a simulated MITM attack.  
- Demonstrated how TLS protects confidentiality/integrity and why trusted CAs are required.
